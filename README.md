# blogapp-ui

The UI is very basic, based on an existing template i took from the Web just to don't spend time on creating it. 
I added a little component for the Post to interact with the API

## Deployed on Firebase

- https://blog-app-ee678.web.app/

## Security

The authentication is based on Firebase Auth to be able to interact with the blog api with the provided token

## Notes
To test the application you can register with a dummy email/pwd and start creating post and switching between different users to see how works the Post's permissions.
